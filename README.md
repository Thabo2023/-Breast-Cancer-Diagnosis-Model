Aims:

Develop a deep learning model for diagnosing breast cancer using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.
Achieve high classification accuracy while prioritising model interpretability to enhance medical decision-making.
Contribute to early detection and treatment planning for breast cancer patients.

Key Findings:
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand dataset characteristics and distributions.
Addressed data issues such as missing values, outliers, and class imbalance.
Normalised features and visualised relationships between variables using correlation matrices and pair plots.
Trained and evaluated three deep learning architectures: basic neural network, deeper neural network, and hyperparameter-tuned model.
Identified the basic neural network as the optimal model based on accuracy and interpretability metrics.

Implementation and Insights:
Deployed the recommended basic neural network model, achieving 98% accuracy on test data.
Provided clinicians with a reliable tool for early breast cancer detection, improving patient outcomes.
Established a framework for interpretable deep learning models in medical diagnostics.

Impact:
Enhanced diagnostic accuracy surpassing existing benchmarks.
Facilitated timely intervention through early detection, potentially saving lives.
Fostered trust among healthcare professionals with interpretable model insights.

Future Directions:
Implement data augmentation techniques to mitigate class imbalance and improve model accuracy.
Explore advanced feature engineering methods to capture more nuanced patterns in breast cancer diagnosis.
Further optimise model hyperparameters and apply regularisation techniques to enhance generalisation.
