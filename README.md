This project compares the perfomance of three different machine learning algorithms ( Logistic regression, Random Forest Classifier, and SVM) on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset to classify tumors as benign (non-harmful) or malignant (harmful) based on features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses.
